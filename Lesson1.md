# Lesson 1 - 4/18/2018 - Project Concept

### Problem to be solved:

---

It has come to light in recent times that social networks, and your online presence in general, contribute large amounts of data that can be used to produce *very* targeted advertising. Even more concerning, advertising is not the only use for this data, it is simply the most beneficial to the companies that wield the data. 

[A study has shown](http://www.pnas.org/content/111/24/8788.full) that social media is a vector for emotional contagions. Although the contagions are spread primarily through direct interactions, the online social network can use the data they accumulate to specifically target susceptible individuals to spread the desired information through their social network. This has widespread implications. 

Ad campaigns are a common use, but this is highly effective in political campaigns as well. If an individual can be convinced through targeted means to spread an *emotion* to their social network regardless of factual data, then you can promote (or slander) a candidate based on how effective you are at convincing the weakest link.

This puts extreme power in the hands of those that control our data. Notably, large social networks of any kind.



### Solution to the problem:

---

There is no simple solution to this problem.

A widespread shift to encrypted communication hidden even to the carrier of the data would be effective in limiting the scope of this problem. 

Any solution requires expanded public awareness and conscious action to protect their own data, as any one individual is susceptible if someone near him is afflicted with an emotional contagion. The shift to private and secure data must be widespread.

[Game theory suggests](http://ncase.me/trust/) we are more trusting and understanding when our social interactions are primarily with a handful of individuals that we have repeated interactions with over a long period of time. A cohesive network of individuals that are known to each other. The internet offers quite the opposite, with a large number of people and that have had little to no previous interaction.

When social networks are smaller, they become more isolated from outside influences. Without some level of caution, this can swing too far in the other direction and lead to isolationism. A middle ground with just the right number of individuals and outside connections must be reached.



### Solution Deliverables:

---

A simple social network composed of users, groups, messages, and events. These four components interact to allow for a wide range of communication capabilities.

All group, message and event data is encrypted client side so the server is unable to read or decode the data. Users have sole access to their data.

To provide further security, the code is open source, allowing anyone to host their own network. 

A cap on the number of users within groups, and the number of users you can 'friend' will prevent users from adding as many people as possible, and instead shift focus to the quality of the interactions.
