# Lesson 2 - 4/18/2018 - Presentation Method 

I will be presenting my project using [GitPitch](https://gitpitch.com/). GitPitch lets me store my presentation in the git repository the rest of my project files are in, and gives me all the features of git. All slides are written in markdown, and then rendered through the GitPitch site as a slideshow. That said, I will need a computer, and a projector. Audio will not be necessary.

To make things easier, my project presentation will always be available using [this link](https://gitpitch.com/GC-Git/CIS297/master).
