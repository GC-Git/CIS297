# Lesson 3 - 4/24/2018 - Project Implementation

My project is a full stack simple social networking site.  


## Design Requirements

- Server: Heroku
- Database : PostgreSQL
- Http Server: NodeJS
- Framework: ExpressJS

The goal here is to have a functional website. The project, for our purposes, will be done when the backend is stable and supports all expected features. 

## Testing
Most testing will be done during development. After all the required features are supported and there are no 'game-breakers' we will start load testing and simulating users to be sure the server will not break after more than a few users are active. The front end will be tested by a small number of live users.
